## Terraform Overview

### Concepts

#### Introduction

1. What is [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io)?
   * open-source tool by [HashiCorp](https://www.hashicorp.com), used for provisioning infrastructure resources
   * supports DevOps best practices for change management
   * Managing configuration files in source control to maintain an ideal provisioning state 
     for testing and production environments
2. What is IaC?
   * Infrastructure-as-Code
   * build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way 
     by defining resource configurations that you can version, reuse, and share.
3. Some advantages
   * Infrastructure lifecycle management
   * Version control commits
   * Very useful for stack-based deployments, and with cloud providers such as AWS, GCP, Azure, K8Sâ€¦
   * State-based approach to track resource changes throughout deployments


#### Files

* `main.tf`
* `variables.tf`
* Optional: `resources.tf`, `output.tf`
* `.tfstate`

#### Declarations
* `terraform`
   * `backend`: state
* `provider`:
   * adds a set of resource types and/or data sources that Terraform can manage
   * The Terraform Registry is the main directory of publicly available providers from most major infrastructure platforms.
* `resource`
  * blocks to define components of your infrastructure
  * Project modules/resources: google_storage_bucket, google_bigquery_dataset, google_bigquery_table
* `variable` & `locals`


#### Execution steps
1. `terraform init`: Initialize & install
2. `terraform plan`: Match changes against the previous state
3. `terraform apply`: Apply changes to cloud
4. `terraform destroy`: Remove your stack from cloud
